# DSH Desktop repository rules

This repository owns WorkDSH Web and Desktop. Desktop and Web consume the same exact official DSH published package version. Desktop binary dependencies and command-management helpers are extracted from checksum-locked official release installers.

## Git branch and release policy

- Keep exactly one long-lived product branch: the GitHub default branch, currently `main`. Do not maintain `main` and `master` as parallel product or release lines.
- Development and migration branches are temporary. Bring every accepted change back to the default branch through a reviewed pull request; verify required checks and that the intended commits are present there before treating the work as delivered.
- Create Desktop release tags and publish product artifacts only from commits reachable from the default branch. A successful build on a temporary branch is validation, not a release.
- After a temporary branch has been merged and its changes verified on the default branch, delete that temporary branch. Retain an unmerged branch only while its work is still under review; do not delete unique history.
- If the default branch is renamed, update GitHub settings, CI, website deployment, release triggers, and documentation together before removing the old branch.

## Prerequisites and setup

- Use Node.js `^22.19.0` or `>=24.0.0` and the root Yarn `4.18.0` release through Corepack.
- Install root dependencies with `corepack yarn install --immutable`.

## Build, run, and verify

- Start the desktop development workflow with `corepack yarn dev`.
- Build the desktop package with `corepack yarn build`.
- Run unit tests with `corepack yarn test`.
- Run type checking with `corepack yarn typecheck`.
- Run the complete headless gate with `corepack yarn check`.
- `apps/desktop/` is the only Desktop source and release workspace. Do not reintroduce a copied Beta package; optional release channels must build from this same source and pinned DSH version.
- The official release version locked in `upstream.json` is the single DSH version for the packaged WorkDSH Profile. Desktop source is an Electron carrier without direct DSH dependencies. A DSH upgrade is incomplete until `corepack yarn check:desktop-dsh-alignment`, the Desktop checks, and a packaged-runtime check pass. Default to the newest official stable DSH release after compatibility validation; use a pre-release only by explicit product decision. Do not tag a Desktop release while the version gate fails. The carrier must contain no second DSH installation.
- `apps/web/` owns Web launch, deployment and verification. Root `packages/` owns shared WorkDSH feature packages, and root `profiles/` owns composition. Its package manifests must declare the same exact DSH version as `upstream.json`; run `corepack yarn check:web-dsh-alignment` when either side changes. The Web workspace remains self-contained and does not import or modify the official source tree.

- `apps/desktop/` owns the Electron carrier, packaging, and release tests. DSH Host and Client code comes from the published official runtime Profile; WorkDSH features belong to the WorkDSH Profile packages.
- The Desktop workspace uses the root Yarn release with `nodeLinker: node-modules`. The nested `apps/web/` workspace retains its own pinned pnpm lockfile and package manager; run its commands from that directory. Do not install it into the root Yarn workspace.
- Keep presentation and WorkDSH feature changes in the Profile rather than adding a second Desktop Host or Client implementation.
- Keep graphical application launch explicit. Builds, typechecks, unit tests, and Loader smokes must remain headless-safe.

## Personal and enterprise product boundary

- Personal Desktop, enterprise Desktop use one validated official DSH version and the same owned feature implementations. Preserve the complete official interface; never copy its settings, sidebar or right panel.
- Enterprise execution is Desktop-only: the official Host, Agent and tools run on the employee computer. Do not restore ECS member processes, a member gateway or remote session storage. Identity, storage, permissions and synchronization are explicit adaptations.
- There is one base Desktop installer. Enterprise account and collaboration plugins are installed explicitly, not shipped in the base runtime. Personal mode does not activate it. Projects are included in Desktop and Web. The server owns administration, authorization, collaboration data and model forwarding; collaboration activates only for authenticated enterprise members; personal mode must not activate it. Notifications and business applications remain optional external plugins.
- The administrator presets only the public backend origin in packaged `workdsh-config.json` via `WORKDSH_DEPLOYMENT_CONFIG`. Login credentials and model keys do not belong in this file.
- WorkDSH Admin owns accounts, organizations, authorization, audited member-visible conversation access and Spring AI internal model APIs. Members manually configure company API, internal Key, protocol and model catalog through official Custom Model API settings; personal providers can coexist. Do not restore enterprise model injection or synchronization.
- Preserve user-facing README content and organize new material in the corresponding sections. Development logs, raw acceptance evidence, credentials and generated packages are not submission content.

- Never clone, import or compile official DSH source as part of product builds. `upstream.json` locks published package versions and Desktop archive URLs, sizes and SHA-512 hashes. Extract only runtime dependencies, Office assets and prebuilt command helpers; do not carry a second official Electron application or DSH installation.

## Delivery regression gate

- Directory migrations must update scripts, CI working directories, test globs and deployment contexts together. Source-only moves are incomplete.
- Required plugin delivery must pass composition, archive dependency closure, installed runtime and actual UI checks. Builds alone are not acceptance.
- Shared feature changes must trigger Desktop and Web CI. Enterprise plugin installation never grants membership; authorization and inactive personal mode remain mandatory.
- Candidate handover requires actual packaged Desktop and backend operation results. Report missing acceptance explicitly; never call a candidate complete while required plugins or entries are missing.
